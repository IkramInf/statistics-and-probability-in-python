# Statistics and probability in python

We will use boston housing dataset to answer the following questions:
  - Is there a significant difference in median value of houses bounded by the Charles river or not? (T-test for independent samples)
  - Is there a difference in Median values of houses (MEDV) for each proportion of owner occupied units built prior to 1940 (AGE)? (ANOVA)
  - Can we conclude that there is no relationship between Nitric oxide concentrations and proportion of non-retail business acres per town? (Pearson Correlation)
  - What is the impact of an additional weighted distance  to the five Boston employment centres on the median value of owner occupied homes? (Regression analysis)
